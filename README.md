# text_RPG
My first personal project undertaken in order to learn Python and a bit of Git.

The objective is to make a small text-based RPG inspired by D&D board games.

The game is designed to be run in a terminal with text input and uses a 'tile' system to explore different tiles in a cave. Once you've explored a pre-determined number of tiles, you'll reach the end tile and win the game. If you survive that long :)

Features implemented so far:
- 3 player classes;
- multiple enemy types;
- different weapons for player and enemies with different stats;
- dynamic tile generation as you explore, with multiple paths and dynamic descriptions;
- "map" of the cave, in the sense that the game remembers where you've been if you backtrack;
- d20 roll for your and enemy's attacks;
- dynamic text description for combat a la Baldur's Gate;
- some enemies can inflict a poisoned condition;
- rest system to regenerate health at the risk of being ambushed.

Features to be implemented:
- more enemy types;
- more player classes;
- a level-up system;
- an inventory system and loot.

I'd also like to implement a sort of ASCII map of the cave that reveals the explored tiles and player location but seems like a lot of tedious work. Will leave it for a very boring week.
