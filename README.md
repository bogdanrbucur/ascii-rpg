# ASCII-RPG
My first personal project undertaken in order to learn Python and a bit of Git.

The objective is to make a small text-based RPG inspired by D&D board games.

The name is a bit deceiving because I discovered that I can't really make any ASCII art but the game only runs in a terminal as of now.

You get to kill Kobolds if your d20s are lucky.
