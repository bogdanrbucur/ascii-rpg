# text_RPG
My first personal project undertaken in order to learn Python and a bit of Git.

The objective is to make a small text-based RPG inspired by D&D board games.

The game is designed to be run in a terminal with text input and uses a 'tile' system to explore different tiles in a cave. Once you've explored a pre-determined number of tiles, you'll reach the end tile and win the game. If you survive that long :)

Features implemented so far:
- choose your starting class;
- multiple enemy types;
- different weapons for player and enemies with different stats;
- dynamic tile generation as you explore, with multiple paths and dynamic descriptions;
- "map" of the cave, in the sense that the game remembers where you've been if you backtrack;
- d20 roll for your and enemie's attacks;
- some enemies can poison you and you need to roll a d20 to get rid of poison;
- a rest system to regenerate health at the risk of being ambushed.

Features to be implemented:
- enemies to attack first if they ambush you while resting;
- more enemy types;
- more player classes;
- a level-up system;
- an inventory system and loot.
